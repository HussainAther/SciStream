# SciStream

SciStream is a revolutionary web platform designed to empower scientists and programmers to share their research in real-time through live streaming. Our prototype features user authentication, a streaming dashboard, and basic chat functionality, providing a seamless experience for both streamers and viewers. With SciStream, researchers can engage with a global audience, foster collaboration, and accelerate the pace of scientific discovery. Join us as we revolutionize the way research is shared and communicated, one stream at a time.

## Week 1: Planning and Design

Concept Refinement: Refine the concept of the research streaming platform based on initial feedback and research. Define the core features and functionality that will be included in the prototype.

User Flow Mapping: Create a basic user flow diagram outlining the steps users will take to stream their research and interact with the platform.

Mockup Creation: Develop simple wireframes or mockups of the platform's key pages, including the streaming dashboard, user profiles, and chat interface.

## Week 2: Backend Development

User Authentication: Implement basic user authentication functionality to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Streaming Infrastructure: Set up a basic streaming infrastructure using a platform like Twitch or YouTube Live to handle live streaming of research sessions.

## Week 3: Frontend Development

Streaming Dashboard: Develop a basic streaming dashboard interface where users can start and manage their live streams. Include options for screen sharing, webcam feeds, and basic chat functionality.

User Profiles: Create simple user profile pages where users can view their streaming schedule, bio, and past streams.

## Week 4: Testing and Iteration

Testing and Feedback: Conduct internal testing of the prototype to identify and fix any bugs or usability issues. Gather feedback from a small group of testers or stakeholders.

Refinement: Iterate on the prototype based on the feedback received, focusing on improving usability, performance, and overall user experience.

## End Goal

By the end of the 26-day period, the goal is to have a functional prototype of the research streaming platform that allows users to sign up, log in, and start live streaming their research sessions. The prototype should include basic features such as user authentication, streaming dashboard, and user profiles, providing a proof of concept for the platform's core functionality.
