# 🌍 SciStream – The Future of Live Research & Coding

> **"The way research is shared is outdated – let's make it live."**

SciStream is an **open-source live-streaming platform** built for **scientists, programmers, and researchers** to share their work in **real-time**. Think of it as **Twitch for Science & Coding** – a place where you can stream experiments, debug models, run live coding sessions, and collaborate globally.

## 🚀 Why SciStream?

✅ **Live Streaming for Researchers & Devs** – Share coding, ML models, experiments in real-time.\
✅ **Real-Time Collaboration** – Integrated chat, code-sharing, and interactive Q&A.\
✅ **Jupyter & Python Support** – Stream **Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, R code** seamlessly.\
✅ **Secure & Open-Source** – Fully **self-hostable** with **privacy controls** for research teams.\
✅ **WebRTC + WebSockets** – Low-latency streaming + real-time chat for full engagement.
