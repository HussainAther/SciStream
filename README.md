# SciStream

SciStream is a revolutionary web platform designed to empower scientists and programmers to share their research in real-time through live streaming. Our prototype features user authentication, a streaming dashboard, and basic chat functionality, providing a seamless experience for both streamers and viewers. With SciStream, researchers can engage with a global audience, foster collaboration, and accelerate the pace of scientific discovery. Join us as we revolutionize the way research is shared and communicated, one stream at a time.

We plan to make SciStream platform unique and tailored to scientists and programmers, 

## Research-Centric Features:

Provide specialized tools and features for sharing research findings, data visualizations, code snippets, and project updates in real-time during live streams.
Integrate support for popular scientific programming languages and tools (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB, Jupyter Notebooks) to facilitate live coding sessions, data analysis, and modeling demonstrations.
Implement features for sharing and annotating research papers, datasets, and references during streams, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among viewers.

## Interactive Learning and Collaboration:

Enable real-time collaboration and pair programming among streamers and viewers through features like shared code editors, whiteboards, and collaborative note-taking tools.
Facilitate interactive Q&A sessions, brainstorming discussions, and peer review sessions during streams, allowing viewers to ask questions, provide feedback, and contribute to ongoing research projects.

## Community Building and Networking:

Create specialized channels, forums, or discussion groups within the platform for different scientific disciplines, research topics, and programming languages, fostering a sense of community and belonging among users.
Organize virtual meetups, workshops, and hackathons within the platform to facilitate networking, skill-sharing, and interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists and programmers.
